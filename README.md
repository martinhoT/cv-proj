# CV project

Project for the Visual Computing course at Universidade de Aveiro, 2022/2023.

## Usage

Most of the modules in `requirements.txt` should be installed.
`panda3d` and `numpy` are required, and `types-panda3d` is simply for easier development.

In order to start the game, run:

```
python3 main.py
```

Various arguments can be passed to the program.
To see the optional arguments, run:

```
python3 main.py -h
```

Most of them are debug options which can allow a better overview of what's behind the scenes.
